          A deep dive into one of my favorite songs by Rex Orange County

          <span className="font-semibold">Pluto Projector</span>, the song, tells a story 
          about what it feels like to promise forever when you're still learning who you are. 
          Rex captures this feeling by projecting his love onto the cosmos, because sometimes 
          only the infinite nature of space feels big enough to hold what you're feeling. But 
          instead of pretending to have the answers, this song invites us to sit in the mess 
          of it. Because in this story the only thing that's truly certain is doubt.

          <span className="text-purple-400">{ ` "'The great protector' is that what I'm supposed to be?" `} </span> 
           {`I've always pictured this song like a movie, with the first couple of lines opening the first scene, where we're introduced to a young man staring at himself, unsure if he's strong enough to shield the person he loves. The phrase "great protector" feels both noble in some ways and simultaneously crushing. Like he's already carrying the weight of someone else's future on his shoulders.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"What if all this counts for nothing? Everything I thought I'd be? What if by the time I realize, it's too far behind to see?"`} </span>  
          {`This is where the doubt starts to flood in. Rex imagines a life where all his efforts collapsed into nothing. Where the version of himself he hoped to become just slips out of reach. This line also inadvertently answers the question of what Rex was trying to protect his lover from: himself. So we're witnessing a kind of spiraling thoughts that turns love into a flimsy question mark instead of the solid anchor that it should be.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Seventy-mil projector, I can show you everything."`} </span>
          {`In the mix of confusion, Rex turns to the sky, referencing the 70 mil projector which is like casting his heart onto a massive cinema screen in an attempt to prove his devotion by making it larger than life like a movie. In this way his love becomes a film reel of all his hopes so she can see the details of everything he doesn't know how to or is too afraid to say out loud.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"And we're on our way to glory, where this show won't ever end."`} </span>
          {`Rex is describing a dreamscape, or a perfect world without goodbyes. He daydreams of a world where their stories play on repeat like a scene that refuses to cut.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"And the encore lasts forever, and it's time we're due to spend."`} </span>
          {`'And the encore lasts forever.' Rex is fantasizing about the rest of their lives being stretched out into the infinite nature of space. He does this because in space, time is no longer sacred, and their love can finally be as infinite as the very stars his love was projected onto in the first place. And with that confession, we transitioned into the second verse.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Spending the years together, growing older every day."`} </span>
           {`The first verse was broadly Rex contemplating about his fears of the future, but the second verse is grounded in the moment in time that he and his love are living in, like right now. Rex and his lover are in the middle of sharing a life together, waking up and watching each other grow older bit by bit. Baked into that image is the reminder that with age comes change, but change seems to be the thing that scares him the most. So that fear of change is why Rex clings to the idea of their encore lasting forever.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"I feel at home when I'm around you, and I'll gladly say again. I hope the encore lasts forever."`} </span>
          {`To Rex, love is safest when it's still, you know? When it feels eternal. So singing 'I hope the encore lasts forever' is really him trying to freeze the moment before change comes in to challenge whatever their bond can withstand the test of time.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Now there's time for us to spend. And it's sublime with you, my friend."`} </span>
          {`Regardless of his fears, right now their love is good. It's a tender love that he describes through their everyday time together feeling sublime. And I really love that lyric because it grounds their love in the beauty of simply just being with somebody, just existing with someone.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"This right here still feels like a honeymoon when you say my name."`} </span>
          {`This is probably one of my favorite lines of the song, not just because of the delivery, but because these lines are all about presence. He's talking about here, right now. When she says his name, the air feels charged again, like the first week of falling in love. He's saying that the honeymoon phase never ended. He just learned how to live inside of the everyday, seemingly ordinary moments.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Nothing's changed; I'm still a boy inside my thoughts. Am I meant to understand my faults?"`} </span>
          {`So here it is. My favorite line because it relates to me a lot. This is what the song's been building up to the entire time: what was Rex so afraid of, the change that he feared, and what he wanted to protect his lover from. This is the moment where Rex drops the veil and just admits that he's still caught between boyhood and adulthood. And this leads him to ask out loud, "Am I meant to understand my faults?" Which doesn't come from denial, like you might think, but really it comes from a place of longing for understanding, like he wonders if anyone ever truly figures themselves out. Or if part of love is learning to grow while someone is watching you trip over yourself. And that's what makes this moment so vulnerable. Rex knows immaturity can fracture his relationship. And here he's hoping honesty will be enough to bridge the gap between him and his lover as he learns to grow as a person.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"I don't think so. I don't think I meant to understand myself. Well, maybe you do, and that's good for you."`} </span>
          {`It sounds like Rex is giving a chase for self-understanding, almost like he decided some people are just going to be mysteries to themselves. But what stings is the comparison, because his lover seems to get it right. She seems to know who she is in ways that Rex just can't. So rather than resentment, he shrugs it off with a bittersweet admiration, saying, 'That's good for you; I'm happy for you, but I'm just not there yet.'`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Well, maybe in time, maybe one day, I'll do the same."`} </span>
          {`The repetition feels like him saying a promise to himself as much as he's saying a promise to her. He admits he's not there yet. But maybe one day he'll catch up to her and her clarity.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"I'll do the same, I'll do the same; oh, I'll do the same."`} </span>
          {`And I said this already, but it's all so bittersweet. Because Rex has hope and doubt tangled together in the same breath as he speaks. Showing that even if he can't fully see himself, he still dreams of a future where he can stand beside her as an equal.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"I'll do the same as you; I'll try and hold it up. Soon, I hope, or as soon as I'm old enough."`} </span>
          {`In a way this moment reads like desperation. He's not just promising to match her effort like I said before, but like, he kind of moves into begging for her to wait while he grows into the person that she already deserves. He knows that he's behind, but he's vowing that he'll figure himself out if she just stays long enough to see it all happen.`}
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-purple-400">{`"Old enough to understand. Old enough to understand."`} </span>
          {`The ending lines are childlike in their simplicity. Almost like he's convincing himself that one day maturity will click into place. But also lands like the softest kind of begging, right? Like he's saying, 'Don't stop growing old with me; I like waking up next to you and watching us grow older bit by bit. Just hold onto me until I'm old enough to deserve this love. Hold onto me until I'm old enough to understand.'`}
