  { name: "Next.js", rating: 55, description: "This is my first time actually using Next.js in a project. I kind of understand the basics of rendering methods ike SSR being server requests, SSG being pre-rendered at build time, and CSRâ€¦ well, I still donâ€™t fully get that one yet. Right now, Iâ€™m just applying what I learn from tutorials and documentation, so Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m still a beginner here.",
    next: "My next step is to build a project that mixes SSR and SSG, start learning how to fetch data the proper way with API routes, and eventually dive into middleware, authentication, and the newer App Router features." },
  { name: "Php", rating: 80, description: "I feel pretty confident with PHP. Iâ€™ve worked with variables, arrays, loops, and conditionals, and I even touched OOP a few times for assignments. I know how GET and POST requests work, and Iâ€™ve practiced RESTful APIs with Postman. Iâ€™ve also built projects with Laravel, including a CRUD app that used tables for teachers and students. Honestly, PHP was my main playground before I shifted more into JavaScript. Iâ€™d say I was a real PHP glazer back then.",
    next: "Next, I should go deeper into advanced Laravel concepts such as authentication, middleware, and API development, while also improving my database optimization skills with MySQL and exploring deployment strategies for real-world PHP applications." },
  { name: "JavaScript", rating: 40, description: "I know the basics like using var, let, and const, and Iâ€™ve done simple DOM manipulation before, like making a wardrobe feature for an assignment. I can debug with console logs and DevTools, but I havenâ€™t really touched async/await, APIs, or advanced concepts yet. Honestly, I still think more in PHP terms when I code, so Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m still at a beginner level in JavaScript.",
    next: "My next step is to properly learn ES6+ features, practice fetching data with APIs, and get comfortable with promises and async/await. Once I get the fundamentals solid, I want to dive into OOP in JavaScript and explore closures and the event loop so I can think more natively in JS." },
  { name: "Luau", rating: 84, description: "Iâ€™ve built multiple systems in Roblox using Luau â€” from combat mechanics and shops to datastores for saving stats, currencies, and fighting styles. I regularly use RemoteEvents, RemoteFunctions, and ModuleScripts to keep my projects efficient and reusable, and Iâ€™ve even experimented with metatables. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m very confident scripting in Roblox, though I still need to push into optimization and advanced CFrame/Vector3 math to reach the next level.",
    next: "My next step is to learn performance optimization with RunService, master OOP patterns using metatables, and improve my use of CFrame and Vector3 for advanced mechanics. I also want to strengthen security in client-server communication and build scalable multiplayer systems for larger games." },
  { name: "Git", rating: 65, description: "Iâ€™ve used Git a lot already â€” initializing repositories, cloning projects, and working with commits feel natural to me now. Iâ€™ve also created branches in team projects, though I still think of them more like backups than proper workflows. Collaborating with friends through GitHub (pushing, pulling, and merging) has given me hands-on experience, but I havenâ€™t really dealt with merge conflicts or undo commands yet. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m sitting at a beginner-intermediate level.",
    next: "My next step is to properly understand branching strategies and learn how to resolve merge conflicts. I also want to explore advanced workflows like rebasing, stashing, and squashing commits, as well as using Git in CI/CD pipelines to improve team collaboration." },
  { name: "MySQL", rating: 72, description: "Iâ€™ve built plenty of databases and tables, and Iâ€™m very comfortable with CRUD queries like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. I understand relationships with primary and foreign keys, and Iâ€™ve learned normalization from 1NF to 3NF to avoid redundancy. Iâ€™ve also experimented with stored procedures and functions, and Iâ€™ve connected MySQL with Laravel/PHP for CRUD apps. While I have strong fundamentals, I havenâ€™t really explored indexes, optimization, or handling large datasets yet.",
    next: "My next step is to dive into optimization: using indexes effectively, analyzing queries with EXPLAIN, and working with larger datasets. I also want to deepen my understanding of transactions, isolation levels, and backups so I can move from database design into real-world scaling and performance tuning." },
  { name: "TailwindCSS", rating: 75, description: "I know how to use Tailwind for layouts, spacing, typography, and responsive design. I can style most UI elements, but Iâ€™m still missing some mastery with transitions, pseudo-states, arbitrary values, dark mode, and deeper Tailwind config customization.",
    next: "Iâ€™ll practice building real-world components like cards, dashboards, navbars, and hero sections. Iâ€™ll also work on responsive + interactive states (hover, focus, active) and start experimenting with dark mode and config customization to push myself toward advanced level." }
